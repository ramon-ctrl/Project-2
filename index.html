                    Cybersecurity is important for people on the internet because it may help in protecting their personal information and prevent them from becoming victims of cybercrime. This can include things like identity theft, fraud, and the theft of financial information. Cybersecurity is especially important for people who use the internet for online banking or shopping, as well as those who store sensitive information on their devices. Without proper cybersecurity measures in place, individuals are at risk of having their personal information and data accessed and used by cybercriminals.

                        Cybersecurity is important on mobile devices for the same reasons it is important for people on the internet in general. Mobile devices are often used to store sensitive information, such as financial information, personal information, and login credentials. If this information is not properly protected, it can be accessed and used by cybercriminals to commit fraud or other types of cybercrime.

                    <p class="three">
                        Additionally, mobile devices are often used to access the internet and can be vulnerable to the same types of cyber threats that affect computers, such as malware and ransomware. As such, it is important to use cybersecurity measures on mobile devices to protect against these threats.

                        Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are an increasingly important part of our daily lives. We use them to access the internet, store sensitive information, and conduct a wide range of activities that are important to us. As a result, it is crucial to ensure that our mobile devices are secure from cyber threats.

                    There are several reasons why cybersecurity is important on mobile devices. For one, mobile devices are often more vulnerable to cyber attacks than other types of devices, such as computers or laptops.

            </div>
            <div class="column three">
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>
                    This is because mobile devices are often used on the go, which makes it easier for cybercriminals to target them with attacks. Additionally, mobile devices often have smaller screens and less sophisticated security systems, making it easier for attackers to gain access to sensitive information.
                </p>

            <div class="column three">

                <p>
                    Overall, it is important to ensure that mobile devices are secure in order to protect against cyber threats and keep sensitive information safe. This can be done through a variety of measures, such as using strong passwords, installing security software, and being cautious when accessing the internet on a mobile device.
